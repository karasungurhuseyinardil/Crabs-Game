# Craps Game

This C# program simulates a dice game. The objective of the game is for the player to win by trying to achieve a specific score.

## How It Works

You roll two dice. After the dice settle, the sum of the spots on the two upward faces is calculated. If the sum is 7 or 11 on the first throw, you win. If the sum is 2, 3, or 12 on the first throw (known as "craps"), you lose. If the sum is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 on the first throw, that sum becomes your "point." To win, you must continue rolling the dice until you match your point. However, rolling a 7 before matching your point results in a loss.
